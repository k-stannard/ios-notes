## Container View Controllers

### What are they?

Container view controllers are view controllers that contain or combine content from other view controllers into a single working interface.

### How do they work?

UITabBarController, for example, will navigate to different views of the app depending on which tab was selected. Same idea applies to a UINavigationController. A navigation controller may contain a back button to allow you to return from the current view to the previous one. 

The navigation controller *contains* the back button. The tab bar controller *contains* buttons that will present different views.
