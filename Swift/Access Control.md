## Access Control in Swift

Access control restricts accessto parts of your code from code in other source files and modules.
Access control may be assigned to indivudual types, such as classes, structs, enums, as well as properties, methods, initializers, and subscripts belonging to those types.

There are currently five access levels in swift

- fileprivate 
- private
- internal
- open
- public

Unless specified, the default access level in Swift is `internal`.
